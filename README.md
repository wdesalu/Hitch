Hitch - A Carpooling Application
=====

An open-source Django app that focused on connecting Drivers, with extra space in their car and who have to pay expensive gas costs, and Passengers, who needed a ride to a destination and are willing to help compensate part of the costs, in an effort to benifit both parties.

Drivers + Passengers = Less Costly Trip

This situation can happen in multiple cases and varieties, and both parties can benefit in all cases. Only if the Driver is going in a similar direction as the Passenger, and is willing to provide the transportation, that everyone in happy. What is a long ride without some friendly company from someone you can relate to in your vicinity?

This app is catered to only focus on college students, or colleagues in your area, that a user can easily relate to. This is only for safety precautions. This is my first Django application and prototype, so I know there will be a lot of inconsistencies. It is a learning process application.

Any feedback would be great. Thank you.
