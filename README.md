Hitch (Work in Progress)
=====

An open-source Django app that focused on connecting Drivers, with extra space in their car and have to pay expensive gas costs, and Passengers, who needed a ride to a destination and are willing to help compensate part of the costs, in an effort to benifit both parties.

Drivers + Passengers = Less Costly Trip

This situation can happen in multiple cases and varieties, and both parties can benefit in all cases. Only if the Driver is going in a similart direction as the Passenger, and is willing to provide the transportation, that everyone in happier. What is a long ride without some friendly company from someone you can relate to in your vicinity.

This app is catered to only college students, or colleagues in your area, that a user can easily relate to. This is only for safety precautions.
